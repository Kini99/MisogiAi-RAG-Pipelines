# Performance Report: Indian Legal Document Search System

## Overview
This report summarizes the performance of the Indian Legal Document Search System, which evaluates four different similarity methods for legal document retrieval:

- **Cosine Similarity**
- **Euclidean Distance**
- **MMR (Diversity)**
- **Hybrid (Entity + Semantic)**

The system uses Sentence Transformers, Legal-BERT-NER, and a Document Processor to process and retrieve relevant legal documents. The evaluation is based on a small dataset (4 documents, 20 chunks) and several standard information retrieval metrics.

## Key Metrics

| Method    | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | NDCG  | Diversity Score | Avg. Precision |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| Cosine    | 1.0000    | 0.0000 | 0.0000   | 1.000 | 0.6183          | 0.6183         |
| Euclidean | 1.0000    | 0.0000 | 0.0000   | 1.000 | 0.6183          | 0.6183         |
| MMR       | 1.0000    | 0.0000 | 0.0000   | 0.919 | 0.6866          | 0.6866         |
| Hybrid    | 1.0000    | 0.0000 | 0.0000   | 1.000 | 0.6183          | 0.6183         |

- **Average Score:** 0.3483
- **Score Range:** -0.0234 to 1.0000

## Observations

- **Precision** is perfect (1.0) for all methods, indicating that when a relevant document is retrieved, it is always correct.
- **Recall** and **F1 Score** are 0.0 for all methods, suggesting that relevant documents are often missed (low coverage).
- **NDCG** (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) is high for most methods, indicating good ranking of relevant results.
- **Diversity Score** is highest for MMR (0.6866), suggesting it retrieves a more varied set of results.
- **Hybrid** and **Cosine** methods perform similarly in most metrics, but MMR stands out for diversity.
- The dataset is very small, which may limit the generalizability of these results.

## Recommendations

1. **Increase Dataset Size:**
   - Expand the number of documents and queries to better evaluate recall and F1 score.
   - Use a more diverse and representative dataset for robust evaluation.

2. **Improve Recall:**
   - Investigate why recall is 0.0 for all methods. This may indicate issues with chunking, indexing, or retrieval thresholds.
   - Tune retrieval parameters (e.g., number of results, similarity thresholds) to improve coverage.

3. **Enhance Diversity:**
   - MMR shows the best diversity. Consider using or further tuning MMR for scenarios where result variety is important.
   - Explore hybrid approaches that combine diversity and semantic relevance.

4. **Metric Tracking:**
   - Track additional metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and user satisfaction for a more comprehensive evaluation.

5. **User Feedback Loop:**
   - Incorporate user feedback to iteratively improve retrieval quality and relevance.

6. **Model Improvements:**
   - Experiment with more advanced or domain-specific models (e.g., fine-tuned Legal-BERT variants).
   - Consider entity-aware or context-aware retrieval enhancements.

## Conclusion

The current system demonstrates strong precision and ranking ability but suffers from low recall. Addressing recall and expanding the dataset are top priorities. MMR is recommended for maximizing diversity, while hybrid methods may benefit from further tuning. Ongoing evaluation and user feedback will be key to continuous improvement.
